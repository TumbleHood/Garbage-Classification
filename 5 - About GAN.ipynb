    "Generative Adversarial Networks - a type of neural network that is typically used for unsupervised learning tasks, such as generating new data that resembles a given dataset. While GANs can be used for classification problems, they are generally not the first choice for this type of task.\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs can be more complicated than other types of neural networks, as they involve two networks (a generator and a discriminator) that are trained against each other. Additionally, GANs can be more challenging to train and require careful tuning of hyperparameters to achieve good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems, traditional supervised learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are generally more commonly used and more straightforward to implement. CNNs are designed to learn features from input images and make predictions based on those features. They can be trained using labeled data and a loss function that encourages the model to make accurate predictions.\n",
